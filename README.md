# Segment Intersection Animation

This project is an interactive animation that visualizes the process of line segment interpolation between two line segments defined by points A, B, C, and D. The animation is created using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## Overview

First Commit

The animation shows two line segments:
-  Segment AB, defined by points A and B
-  Segment CD, defined by points C and D

As the animation progresses, points M and N interpolate between A and B, and C and D respectively. The goal is to eventually expand this code to calculate the intersection point of the two line segments.
